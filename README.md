# EELE 367 Final Project

This is the final project for EELE 367, Logic Design (a course covering logic
circuit design with VHDL, as well as implementation on an FPGA). This assignment
was created by Professor Brock LaMeres. Relevant course material is available in
Professor LaMeres' textbook, *Introduction to Logic Circuits & Logic Design with
VHDL*.

## Project Phases

This project consists of several stages, culminating in an FPGA implementation
of a rudimentary RISC computer system:

1. [VHDL skeleton](https://github.com/LRitzdorf/eele367-final-project/tree/stage-1)
2. [Simulation of four basic instructions](https://github.com/LRitzdorf/eele367-final-project/tree/stage-2)
3. [FPGA implementation of basic instructions](https://github.com/LRitzdorf/eele367-final-project/tree/stage-3)
4. [Implementing additional instructions](https://github.com/LRitzdorf/eele367-final-project/tree/stage-4)

## System Architecture

The computer system can run in a simulation environment, or as real logic
circuitry allocated from the fabric of a field-programmable gate array (FPGA)
chip. The simulation environment allows for simple verification of functionality
and direct observation of internal system components, and is incredibly useful
when debugging systems such as this.

### Simulation

When run as a simulation, the computer system is comprised of the following
entities:

- `computer_TB`: VHDL test bench to verify system functionality; provides basic
  control signals and I/O connections, but is not synthesizable
  - `computer` core entity (see below)

### FPGA Implementation

When synthesized and implemented on an FPGA, the computer system is comprised of
the following entities:

- `top`: top-level entity; forms the basis for synthesis and flashing to an FPGA
  - `computer` core entity (see below)
  - `char_decoder`: translates 4-bit binary numbers into control signals for a
    seven-segment display
  - `precision_clock_divider`: divides the 50MHz clock on the Intel DE10-Lite
    board down to another (selectable) frequency; allows logic to be run at
    observable speeds for verification and high speeds for practical testing

### Computer Core

The core `computer` entity is the top level of the "real" computer unit. It is
composed of the following:

- `opcodes`: VHDL package; declares constant opcode values for the control
  unit and ROM (program memory)
- `cpu`: instantiates and connects the processor control unit and the data
  path
  - `control_unit`: finite state machine; implements the CPU's
    fetch-decode-execute cycle to control operations in the data path
  - `data_path`: contains registers, buses, and general data wiring;
    performs data manipulation as directed by the control unit
    - `alu`: arithmetic/logical unit; performs more complex data
      manipulation (arithmetic and logical operations) as necessary
- `memory`: directly implements I/O ports and instantiates ROM and RW memory
  modules; controls memory mapping so that subcomponents do not need to be
  aware of their positions in the mapped system
  - `rom_128x8_sync`: synchronous ROM (program) memory, containing 128 8-bit
    addresses (1024 bits of total space)
  - `rw_96x8_sync`: synchronous RW (data) memory, containing 96 8-bit
    addresses (768 bits of total space)

## Opcodes/Mnemonics

The computer system implements the following mnemonics:

Mnemonic  | Opcode | Operand(s)      | Function
----------|--------|-----------------|---------
`LDA_IMM` | `0x86` | Value           | Load register A using immediate addressing

`SUB_AB`  | `0x43` |                 | Subtract the unsigned value in register B from register A
`AND_AB`  | `0x44` |                 | Logical AND register A with register B

`DECB`    | `0x49` |                 | Decrement the value in register B by one
`BRA`     | `0x20` | Program address | Branch always
`BMI`     | `0x21` | Program address | Branch when ALU negative flag is set
`BPL`     | `0x22` | Program address | Branch when ALU negative flag is clear
`BEQ`     | `0x23` | Program address | Branch when ALU zero flag is set
`BNE`     | `0x24` | Program address | Branch when ALU zero flag is clear
`BVS`     | `0x25` | Program address | Branch when ALU overflow flag is set
`BVC`     | `0x26` | Program address | Branch when ALU overflow flag is clear
`BCS`     | `0x27` | Program address | Branch when ALU carry flag is set
`BCC`     | `0x28` | Program address | Branch when ALU carry flag is clear
`NOP`     | `0x00` |                 | No-op (do nothing and continue executing)
`HALT`    | `0xFF` |                 | End program execution

## Memory Mapping

Total available address space ranges from `0x00` to `0xFF`, and is allocated as
follows:

Allocation   | Start  | End
-------------|--------|----
ROM          | `0x00` | `0x7F`
RW memory    | `0x80` | `0xDF`
Input ports  | `0xE0` | `0xEF`
Output ports | `0xF0` | `0xFF`
