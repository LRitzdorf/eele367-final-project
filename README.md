# EELE 367 Final Project

The final project for EELE 367, Logic Design (a course covering logic circuit
design with VHDL, as well as implementation on an FPGA).

This project consists of several stages, culminating in an FPGA implementation
of a rudimentary RISC computer system:

1. VHDL skeleton
2. Simulation of four basic instructions
3. FPGA implementation of basic instructions
4. Implementing additional instructions
